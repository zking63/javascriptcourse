logarithms 
some algorithms have a more complex Big O - some expressions involve complex math with logarithms 

logarithms are the inverse of exponentiation 

log2(8) = 3 —- 2^3 =8 (log2 has base of 2)
log base (value) = exponent 

we omit the base so log == log2 but in math log alone usually isn’t just log alone. 

the logarithm of a number roughly measures the number of times you can divide that number by 2 before you get a value that’s less than or equal to 1. 

logarithm complexity 
if you have an algo with logarithmic time complexity that’s good! this is fast. 

Who cares? 
certain searching algos have log time complexity. 

efficient sorting algos involve logs 
recursion sometimes involves log space complexity
